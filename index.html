        <h1>Alvin Lum</h1>
        <p>My name is Alvin, I was born in September 20 1995, I have a bachelors degree
            in Computer Science from Ontario Tech University and I'm currently working as a data analyst. 
            I've worked on a number of projects like bouncy bob and a flight reservation app. Some of the activities
            I do for fun are archery and sports like soccer.
